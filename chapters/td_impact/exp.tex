\section{Expected Outcome} %5.2
\label{section5.2}
From the assumption of a larger delay declining the performance of Nordic grid and the results from Section~\ref{section4.4}, I expect in this chapter, 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The acceptable points will be less if the time delay is increased.  
    \item To the best result of different delay, kp should be larger when time delay is increased.  
\end{itemize}


I make this assumption based on my experience of waiting for traffic light. At first I didn't notice the green light until the car behind reminded me. In order to make up for the few seconds I missed, I stepped on the accelerator to increase the speed.  \\

With the same reason, the signal facing a time delay problem should make up the errors by accelerating the speed of it. Thus, kp will increase if the time delay increases.

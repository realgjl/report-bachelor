\section{Ramp Rate Analysis} %5.5
\label{section5.5}
Similar to Section~\ref{section4.5}, it's important to consider the aspect of ramp rate to make sure a scientifically correct although I didn't simulate the results for this Chapter due to the results in Section~\ref{section4.5}. \\

However, we can still draw a conclusion that the limit of ramp rate will remove some fast tuning results from one of the conclusions in Section~\ref{section4.5}. More than that, we can reasonably infer the following conclusions: due to the fact that some higher-kp tuning results has been removed by a larger time delay (Figure~\ref{5_4_1_without_Outlier2}), ramp rate affects the tuning results of higher time delay less than the tuning results of lower time delay.

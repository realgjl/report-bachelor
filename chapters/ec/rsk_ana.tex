\section{Ramp Rate Analysis} % 6.5

Like what we do in Section~\ref{section4.5} and in Section~\ref{section5.5}, we need to find the ramp rate in the emergency control. Results are as Table~\ref{6_5_risk}. Comparing Table~\ref{4_5_risk} and Table~\ref{6_5_risk}, we can find that the grid needs a larger ramp rate in the emergency control which shows that an alert state does weaken the stability of the system.

\section{Expected Outcome} %4.2
\label{section4.2}

From discussions before, we know that both kp and ki can not be expanded indefinitely since we have specialised limit for kp and ki in MATLAB program. Thus, firstly, I hope to see a clear borderline that separates the acceptable and unacceptable results. The acceptable results will be expressed as blue points in Excel.  \\

Secondly, I hope to see a relationship between the best point, which has minimum settling time among all the acceptable results, and other acceptable points. I expect the best point will not appear in the borderline because the points in the borderline are likely to be unstable if the delay increases.  \\

I also do not hope the best point has a large or small kp and ki. A larger kp produce a larger overshoot although it would be relatively faster. A small kp has a larger probability of producing a steady-state error and it is relatively harder to approach a settled statement. A larger ki produces more oscillations, as Figure~\ref{3_4_1_larger_ki} shows, and thus it is also hard to approach a settled statement. A small ki does not help fixing the steady-state error along with a small kp.\\
